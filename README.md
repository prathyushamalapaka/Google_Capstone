Approximately 40 million used vehicles are sold each year. Effective pricing strategies can help any company to efficiently sell its products in a competitive market and making profit. In the automotive sector, pricing analytics play an essential role for both companies and individuals to assess the market price of a vehicle before putting it on sale or buying it. And, the rise of used cars sales is exponentially increasing. Car sellers sometimes take advantage of this scenario by listing unrealistic prices owing to the demand.

Therefore, arises a need for a model that can assign a price for a vehicle by evaluating its features taking the prices of other cars into consideration. In this Notebook, we use supervised learning methods to predict the prices of used cars. The model has been chosen after careful exploratory data analysis to determine the impact of each feature on price.

So, we propose a methodology using Machine Learning models to predict the prices of used cars given the features. The price is estimated based on the number of features as mentioned above.
